	                    	Be it known that Kappa Kappa Psi, National Honorary Fraternity for College Bandmembers, is an organization operating exclusively in the field of the college and university bands, and for the following several purposes:
	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                        1. To promote the existence and welfare of the college and university bands and to cultivate at large a wholesome respect for their activities and achievements.
	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                    	2. To honor outstanding bandmembers through privilege of membership extended as a reward for technical achievement and appreciation for the best in music.
	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                    	3. To stimulate campus leadership and promulgate an uncompromising respect through the medium of the college band for gracious conduct, good taste and unswerving loyalty.
	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                    	4. To foster a close relationship between college bands and promote a high average of attainment by the performance of good music and selection of worthwhile projects.
	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                    	5. To provide a pleasant and helpful social experience for all engaged in college band work and to cooperate with other musical organizations in any manner consistent with the purposes of the institution at which chapters are located.
	                    </p>
	                </div>

	            </div>

	            <div class="row tim-row">
	                <h2 class="text-center">This is Kappa Kappa Psi…</h2>
	                <legend></legend>
	                <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
	                <p>
	                	Kappa Kappa Psi operates primarily as a student service and leadership recognition society whose chief aim is to assist the Director of Bands in developing the leadership and enthusiasm that is required of his/her band. Our goals are to provide the band not only with organized and concentrated service activities, but to give our membership valid and wholesome experiences in organization, leadership and social contacts. The honorary nature of membership is based on our premise that “it is an honor to be selected to serve” this band, its department of music, its sponsoring institution, and the cause of band music in the nation’s colleges and universities.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    The Fraternity is presently located in over 150 colleges and universities. Since 1919 more than 50,000 interested bandmembers have devoted their efforts to strengthening their bands through group and individual service projects. The Fraternity’s program of continued service to Music has attracted the attention of the best in American band tradition. We number among our ranks John Philip Sousa, Karl King, Frank Simon, Herbert L. Clarke, Harold Bachman, William D. Revelli and many other contemporary composers, conductors and music educators.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    Through its commissioning program, the Fraternity has presented such noted works as Francis McBeth’s The Seventh Seal, Claude T. Smith’s Symphony #1 for Band, and Fisher Tull’s Prelude & Double Fugue.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                	On the local level, chapter responsibilities include numerous concentrated service projects as well as providing the intangible items of morale, spirit, enthusiasm, atmosphere and attitude within the band. As noted in the preamble of our Constitution and as charged in much of our Ritual, the cultivation and maintenance of an agreeable and enthusiastic attitude is mandatory for all our members, and this serves to foster the wholesome and cooperative spirit that each Director of Bands wants for their band.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                	The actual petitioning process and colonization period are designed to make sure that the student membership is ready to render valid service to your band, as well as for the Director and Administration to determine if this is the type of organization activity that is needed in the band program. There is a colonization period of one year in which we, the Director of Bands and the students, all have an opportunity to assess any programs the group undertakes. The services of the National Headquarters and any of the surrounding chapters are available to petitioning groups at all times for advice, suggestions and assistance during this period, to insure adherence to our goals.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                	The educational value to the student of participation in a smaller group’s activities cannot be overemphasized. Experience in planning, organizing and carrying through projects to benefit the larger band organization are necessary if a well-rounded and responsible student leader is to be trained. The fraternal group, as embodied by our active chapters, provides this needed training group for the student by establishing both worthy goals and worthwhile guideposts for a meaningful college experience.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                	Membership in Kappa Kappa Psi thus becomes an educational and service activity as well as social one. And it is this kind of activity that enriches the band student’s life and sharpens an appreciation for both the best in Music and what it takes to achieve it. It is to this end that our National Fraternity is dedicated, and we cordially invite your participation in this effort.
