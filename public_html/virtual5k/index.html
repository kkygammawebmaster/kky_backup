        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Who is <a href="">gamma</a>? </br> gamma is the University of Washignton's chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi, a group dedicated to service and promotion of the university and community bands.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What is a virtual 5k? </br> A virtual 5k serves as a medium through which people can demonstrate support of a cause, as well as their running ability. You can choose your own time and place to run, and can be social or non-social about it. For testing, I'd like this paragraph to be longer so I will keep writing. This will be a great paragraph. It already is, so I think I will stop here.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>what's in it for me? </br> Support of a great cause! Social dominance, boasting of a 5k! And perhaps best of all, a medal/t-shirt/something else.</p>
            </li>
