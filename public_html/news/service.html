                        <p dir="ltr">Following is a recap of Husky Marching Band Jr/Sr Day, one of Gamma&#8217;s largest service projects, by our immediate past Service Committee Head, Grey Larson. The high schoolers had a great time, saying such kind words as: <em>&#8220;Thanks to all of the amazing HMB members who mentored us and made sure we had an amazing time! I&#8217;m so excited to be a part of this (hopefully) next year!” (Breanna K.) and “They were really chill and really nice and I want to go to UW now.” (Patrick S.).</em></p>
                        <p dir="ltr">We look forward to continuing to put on fun and effective service projects.</p>

                        <p dir="ltr">Every Spring, the UW Football team holds an open practice/field day where the players scrimmage, interact with the crowd, and preview what the Fall Football Season might look like.

This event has become known to the band as Junior/Senior Day and for the first time since 2011, we hosted it once again this past April. The planning for this project started back in January, with Eric Quach writing a project proposal to Dr. McDavid. Once the project was approved, we started coordinating with Josh Chan to come up with a website and start planning the structure of the day. Our beautiful website was designed by our very own Clint Malcolm, and included information about HMB, what Junior/Senior Day is about, and a link to register.</p>
                        <p dir="ltr">Leading up to the day, Dr. McDavid sent out emails to band directors throughout the state and we talked to local high schools to spread the word of the event. We also scanned copies of music so the high school students could print it out and practice beforehand.was designed by our very own Clint Malcolm, and included information about HMB, what Junior/Senior Day is about, and a link to register.</p>
                        <p dir="ltr">Finally, Junior/Senior Day was here! Arriving bright and early at 7:00 am, all volunteers were excited and ready to have a day dedicated to high schoolers. We split up into teams, some people handing out parking passes, some people guiding the students to East Court where they would be rehearsing, some people checking out instruments, and some people as &#8220;designated minglers&#8221; making sure everyone felt welcome. Once all the high schoolers had arrived, Dr. McDavid and our drum majors lead a fast-paced rehearsal teaching them almost every fan favorite song we play. To split up the rehearsal, the Office of Admissions made a presentation about how to apply to UW and what to do once you get in. After that it was back to more rehearing before lunch.</p>

                        Following lunch, the high schoolers and volunteers from Gamma met up with the rest of the band. We played for two hours throughout the Spring Preview, adding lots of positive energy to the day. Despite the pouring rain, all of the high schoolers had a great time and we&#8217;re just happy to feel like they were a part of the band.
