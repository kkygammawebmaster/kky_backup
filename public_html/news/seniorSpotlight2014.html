                        <p>This coming Fall, Matt will be attending the University of California, Berkeley pursuing a Masters Degree in Math and Science Education. He plans to teach high school math after completing his graduate work.</p>
                        <p>&#8220;I have grown so much through my involvement in Kappa Kappa Psi. Coming into college, I was not planning on joining a fraternity, and I initially did not know what I was getting myself into. But I have loved every minute of this experience, from going through the PM Process with my Alpha Gamma class to serving as this year&#8217;s Chapter President. I would love to thank everybody that I have met through Kappa Kappa Psi and Gamma. But in particular, I would like to thank my Big Brother Carmen for her love and support through everything, Brent Nagamine for being a mentor and a horrible influence on me, and Kerry Sloan for being an awesome Vice President this past year. I wish the best of luck to next year&#8217;s President, Kaila Eason, and I know that she will do amazing things for the chapter.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>Jordan is excited to announce that he will be starting a career with UBS, a financial services company, at a branch in Downtown Seattle. He will be starting as a Branch Technical Liaison, serving the branch with technical support, systems implementation, and providing coordination between the corporate IT Office in New York. He hopes that this experience will advance him to the world of technology consulting, a field that he is passionate about at this point in his life. He begins working at this position right after graduation &#8211; no rest for the weary!</p>
                        <p>&#8220;I would like to take the opportunity to thank Gamma for all the memories, laughs, pains, experiences, and bonds made since I became a member of Kappa Kappa Psi. I truly believe this chapter has fulfilled its potential since I started in Gamma and, now that I am leaving, I know Gamma will continue to have a bright future in the years to come. Special shout outs to my amazing Alpha Gamma class&#8230;I love seeing all of us taking off in different directions, supporting each other as we follow our dreams, I couldnt have asked for a more supportive/strong class than you guys to grow with in this chapter. To my Rogers family &#8212; continue to rock the Rogers family love. And last but not least, my Big Bro Brad Carl for being my inspiration to work hard for this chapter, and to my littles Melissa, Becca, and Ashlyn, you three are so special to me in your own ways and I cannot wait to see what the future has to hold for each of you!</p>
                        <p>Thanks again Gamma &#8212; you da best.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>&#8220;I had a great time. I may not have been the most active of actives, but I met some amazing people and made some unforgettable (*that&#8217;s what you are*) memories! I&#8217;m so happy knowing how much this chapter has grown since I was a PM and challenge all the future active members to explore the different chapters of KKPsi and travel as much as you can! That is the only regret I have while being in KKPsi; I didn&#8217;t travel enough and therefore didn&#8217;t make great ties until this year (better late then never, but still). Special shout out to Alumni Nathan Akamine, you were the one that told me I should check out KKPsi and thought I would be a good fit in it (if you don&#8217;t remember, ask me about it and I&#8217;ll remind you). Well you were right and I&#8217;d like to thank you for that push. May music be the food of life, play on. AEA &amp; MLITB :)&#8221;</p>

                        <p>This summer Mitchell will be applying to Medical Schools around the country in hopes that he will be entering in the fall 2015 class of medical students. In the meantime, he will be working two positions in research, one at the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease, and another at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Both of these positions involve bacterial pathogens, and he is very excited to have landed such amazing work in the medical field. Mitchell will still be living in the University District, and will be part of the Siren Team with Alex Donaldson for all of the home Husky Football games in the fall. He can&#8217;t wait for this upcoming year and the opportunity to add to the Gameday atmosphere! Go Dawgs!</p>
                        <p>&#8220;I would like to sincerely thank Gamma and all of the members of Kappa Kappa Psi for the support, memories, and brotherhood over the past 4 years. The dedication and enthusiasm you have all shown for Kappa Kappa Psi and serving the college and community has inspired me in many ways to be a better musician and person. While at times I may seem grumpy during long chapter meetings (don&#8217;t we all), I am very proud to have been a part of this group, and will always remember the little moments in my time as an active. Whether that is something as large as retreat, or something as simple as grabbing coffee with a brother or prospective member. Thank you all again for the greatest college experience I could ask for. I&#8217;ll still be around the area &#8211; let me know when you are free and want to catch up!&#8221;</p>
